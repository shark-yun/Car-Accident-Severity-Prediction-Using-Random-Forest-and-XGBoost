# Car-Accident-Severity-Prediction-Using-Random-Forest-and-XGBoost

## Abstract

The most common cause of death of teenagers and
younger adults is a vehicle accident. Over the past
few years, fatalities in vehicle crashes have been de-
clining, but there were still 39,404 fatalities in 2018.
US-Accidents can be used for numerous applications
such as real-time car accident prediction, studying car
accidents hot spot locations, casualty analysis and ex-
tracting cause and effect rules to predict car accidents
severity, and studying the impact of precipitation or
other environmental stimuli on accident occurrence.
The most recent release of the dataset can also be use-
ful to study the impact of COVID-19 on traffic behavior
and accidents. In order to reduce the severity of the
harmful effects on human and property damage, it
will be helpful to identify the main causes of traffic
accidents. The severity of an accident is not random; it
has patterns that can be recognized and avoided. Thus,
finding an efficient model to successfully predict car
accident severity is significant and urgent. 

The goal of this Kaggle project is to predict the
severity status of car accidents in U.S using statistical
learning models based on the given data, and this
report provides a clear and detailed description on
how we build our classification model from start to
the end, including introduction, exploratory data
analysis, data cleaning, feature selection, model
construction, analyzing results, discussing limitations
and recommendations. The final model is based on
random forest and uses 65 variables. It has accuracy
score of 0.9435.
